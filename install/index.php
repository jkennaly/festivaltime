<h1>System requirements</h1>
This system was developed on a server running Ubuntu 12.04. The following software was installed:
<ul>
<li>Apache/2.2.22</li>
<li> MySQL Server version 5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.04.1-log</li>
<li>MySQL client version 5.5.29</li>
<li>PHP extension: mysqli</li>
<li>PHP Version5.3.10-1ubuntu3.5</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prepare the database</h1>
You will need to create a database for the system to store data in. After creating the database and a user, open the variables/variables.php file and update the information there. This install assumes that the user has full privileges to the database, although this may not be strictly necessary.
